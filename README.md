# Dynamic-ADR-Spreading-Factor-and-power-in-LoRa-Networks
In this paper, we propose an improved version of the original ADR algorithm which dynamically and almost irrespectively of the number of nodes configures transmission parameters including the spreading factor and transmit power of the nodes in LoRa networks with variable channel conditions.
In the proposed algorithm, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) is employed as a decisionmaking method capable of considering the channel condition inconfiguring the transmission parameters. Using OWA makes the
proposed algorithm perform well at all channel conditions asdemonstrated by our numerical results. Also, simulation results show that the packet delivery ratio of the proposed algorithm in
a sub-urban scenario with high channel noise is 4 and 1:5 times of the original ADR and other algorithms, respectively, while it consumes the least energy compared to the others.

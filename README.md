# Dynamic-ADR-Spreading-Factor-and-power-in-LoRa-Networks
This repository contains code related to the analysis of LoRaWAN network simulation results based on an "Dynamic Spreading Factor and Power Allocation of LoRa Networks for Dense IoT Deployments" paper
You can find more details in [IEEE Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217283/authors#authors) paper.
Simulation codes are also available in [git link] (https://github.com/JaberBabaki/flora).
